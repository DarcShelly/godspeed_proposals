**Project Proposal**

**Title:**
Automated Code Review with GitHub API and Callback Integration

**Objective:**
Enhance software project management by integrating GitHubâ€™s APIs and features to automate code reviews, streamline workflows, and improve collaboration. This involves:
- Real-time tracking of GitHub events like commits and pull requests.
- Automating responses and updates using webhooks and callbacks.
- Building a sample microservice using the EventSource plugin.

**Scope and Deliverables:**

- **Scope:**
  - Integration with the GitHub API to manage repositories and track events.
  - Setting up webhooks to listen for GitHub events and trigger callbacks.
  - Implementing GitHub Actions to automate workflows and tasks.
  - Developing a microservice using Node.js to demonstrate real-time event tracking with the EventSource plugin.

- **Deliverables:**
  - A functional microservice capable of tracking and responding to GitHub events in real-time.
  - Demonstration of automated workflows using GitHub Actions.
  - Documentation detailing the setup, usage, and code explanation of the microservice.

**Methodology:**
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Study GitHub API documentation to identify relevant endpoints.
   - Research webhooks and their role in event-driven systems.
   - Understand the EventSource plugin.

2. **Development**
   - Build the microservice using Node.js for handling GitHub API calls and webhook events.
   - Integrate the EventSource plugin to stream and process real-time updates.
   - Configure GitHub Actions to automate tasks like code review notifications and issue tracking.

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Simulate GitHub events (e.g., push commits, create pull requests) and verify webhook-triggered actions.
   - Test the microservice for reliability, efficiency, and accuracy.

4. **Documentation and Delivery**
   - Create a step-by-step guide on setting up the microservice and integrating it with GitHub.
   - Deliver the source code and supporting documentation.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **Programming Languages:** Node.js
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions
- **Event Streaming:** EventSource plugin
- **Webhooks:** For real-time event handling
- **Testing Tools:** Postman and mocha (or equivalent)

**Timeline:**
| **Phase**              | **Duration** | **Completion Date** |
|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Requirements Analysis   | 3 days       | Dec. 20, 2024       |
| Development             | 12 weeks      | Jan. 1, 2025        |
| Testing and Validation  | 5 days       | Jan. 6, 2025       |
| Documentation and Delivery | 2 day    | Jan. 8, 2025       |

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A reusable microservice that integrates with GitHub for automated code reviews and event handling.
