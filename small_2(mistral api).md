**Project Proposal**

**Title:**
Integration of Native Mistral SDK for AI-Powered Workflows

**Objective:**
Enhance AI-powered workflows by integrating the Mistral SDK into Godspeed workflows for access of Mistral model to generate code, images, and text. A robust datasource plugin and a sample microservice will be developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Mistral model and streamline AI-driven task automation.

**Scope and Deliverables:**

- **Scope:**
  - Integrating the Mistral SDK into Godspeed workflows.
  - Developing a datasource plugin to act as a bridge between the Mistral model and the workflows.
  - Building a sample microservice to showcase use of the plugin and SDK in generating code, images, and text.

- **Deliverables:**
  - A fully functional datasource plugin showcasing interaction with the Mistral model.
  - A sample microservice demonstrating code generation, text generation, and image creation using the Mistral SDK.
  - Documentation for setup, integration, and usage of the plugin and microservice.

**Methodology:**
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Understand the Mistral SDK capabilities and its integration points within Godspeed workflows.
   - Analyze the requirements for the datasource plugin to interact effectively with the Mistral model.

2. **Development**
   - Implement the datasource plugin to serve as the connection between Godspeed workflows and the Mistral model.
   - Build a sample microservice using Node.js or Python FastAPI to demonstrate SDK capabilities.
   - Integrate functionalities for generating text, code, and images.

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Validate the datasource plugin by invoking Mistral model functions within Godspeed workflows.
   - Test the sample microservice for accuracy and performance in generating content.

4. **Documentation and Delivery**
   - Create a step-by-step guide for installing and using the plugin and microservice.
   - Deliver the source code and supporting materials.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python (FastAPI), Node.js
- **Mistral SDK**: For AI-driven content generation
- **Godspeed Workflows**: Integration platform
- **Testing Tools:** Postman, pytest (for Python), or equivalent
